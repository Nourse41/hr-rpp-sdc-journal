## Goals:
- [ ] create user with ability to login
- [ ] set up postgreSQL tables
- [ ] import data into postgreSQL tables

## Notes:
- NEVER INSTALL POSTGRESQL *ANYTHING* USING ANTHING BUT HOMEBREW!!!!

## CLI Scripts:
- Login to postrges master user: ```psql -U postgres;```
- Give the role permission to log in: ```ALTER ROLE "*username*" WITH LOGIN;```

### Change psql port number:
*previous port number === 5432*
- cd /opt/homebrew/var/postgres/
- #port = 5431
- vim postgresql.conf

**SWITCHING TO MYSQL!!!**
