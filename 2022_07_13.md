## Explain decisions of file structure

# PRE-INDEXING:
![](Resources/pre-indexing-performance.png)
## Analysis:
Prior to indexing, the data base has to search through every entry in the data base to find the matching value in a row, which is an expensive mememory operation.

![](Resources/post-indexing-performance.png)
## Analysis:
Post indexing, like a hash table, the most relivant columns have been index and it becomes a constant time operation to find a matching matching column in a row
