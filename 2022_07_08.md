## Goals:
- [ ] Create queries/refine routes

## Notes:
-

## CLI Scripts:
### get/reviews by review_id
- SELECT * FROM reviews LEFT JOIN photos ON reviews.id = photos.review_id WHERE review_id = 5;
  - returns list of reviews, each with a url field vs column with array of urls ![](Resources/query%20example.png)

### put/reviews/review_id/report
- UPDATE reviews SET helpfulness=helpfulness+1 WHERE id = 1; -- WORKS!!!!
-
### put/reviews/review_id/report
- UPDATE reviews SET reported=true WHERE id = req.body.review_id -- PROBABLY WORKS!!!!

## Error codes:
