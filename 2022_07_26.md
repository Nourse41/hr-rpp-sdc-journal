## Goals:
- [ ] Database Deployed and data loaded on ec2
- [ ] Server Deployed on ec2

- [ ] SDC Sprint Reflection
- [ ] HR Absence Notification (include info in email response to Stephanie) https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6ttJuUJUwB-IAPMPlgwZcGBo3qgxVhGKrlwbsqCdf86eNgQ/viewform
- [ ] Email response to Stephanie

## Questions
- how to import data onto EC2 instance from google drive url link??? (2.97 GB of .cvs files)
- ```wget --load-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=$(wget --quiet --save-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILEID' -O- | sed -rn 's/.*confirm=([0-9A-Za-z_]+).*/\1\n/p')&id=FILEID" -O FILENAME && rm -rf /tmp/cookies.txt``` https://medium.com/@acpanjan/download-google-drive-files-using-wget-3c2c025a8b99

## CLI Scripts:
-

## Notes
- [X] USE NVM TO INSTALL NPM ON EC2 INSTANCE
  - ```sudo apt install curl```
  - ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash```
  - ```source ~/.bashrc```
  - ```nvm install node```
  - ```nvm install 16.14.2``` installs & switches node versions
  - ```node -e "console.log('Running Node.js ' + process.version)"``` === local=v16.14.2 / EC2=v16.16.0
- [ ] save an image of EC2 instance once mySQL is set up and running (as working backup image)
- [X] set up gitingore to sensitive files (refrence FEC project)
- [ ] Recommended: Containerize your service prior to deployment using Docker.
- [X] You should expect to use multiple EC2 instances: at least one for your service and one for your DBMS
- elastic IDS -- look up & set up
- *** USE SUDO IN UBUNTU ***
- [ ] create connection to mysql DBMS using EC2 url


## ERRORS:
- Error connecting to EC2 instance ```ssh -i "config/SDCkey.cer" ubuntu@ec2-3-143-172-182.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com```
